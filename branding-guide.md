### Kansai Scene API 

# Branding Guide

All applications must be accompanied by a Kansai Scene API logo on any page or screen that displays Kansai Scene API content or data. The logo must link directly to https://dev.kansaiscene.com/.

For applications that do not easily support logos or where Kansai Scene data are used in alternative media formats, the written attribution "Data provided by Kansai Scene" can be substituted.

Prior written consent from Kansai Scene is required to use Kansai Scene data without attribution.

## API LOGOS

## ADDITIONAL BRANDING REQUIREMENTS

The selected logo should be full and clearly visible, not altered or resized, or covered up in any way.

The Kansai Scene logo should not be the most prominent element or logo on the Web page, nor the only branding on the page.

Do not use the logo or text attribution in a way that would suggest that Kansai Scene promotes or endorses you or any third party or the causes, ideas, Web sites, products or services of you or any third party.

Please also read the Attribution Requirements.
